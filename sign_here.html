This is a very simple HTML file, consisting of a header, a paragraph break, and an un-numbered list. You should edit this file with a plain text editor. Check before placing your pull request that you have only edited the line with your own name. The most common reason for failing at this is using an inappopriate text editor: Do not use a web page editor, as these concern themselves only with the rendered presentation of the html, not the underling text. You are also advised not to use MS Word or Mac Notes or TextEdit, since these may add hidden lines and are not good for editing plain text files. It is useful to become familiar with one or more plain text editors such as nano, emacs, vi, pico. Code editors such as vscode and the RStudio editor can be effective for this, too, but they also may suppress some lines of text to try to improve your coding experience.
