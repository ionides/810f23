<h2 id="if-your-latex-distribution-is-missing-sty-files">If your Latex
distribution is missing <code>sty</code> files</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You can copy missing <code>sty</code> files into your working
directory from the internet .</p></li>
<li><p>Better, you can get a more complete Latex distribution. On a Mac,
if you install <code>Xcode</code>,
<code>Xcode command line tools</code>, and <code>MacPorts</code> (all of
which are good to have for scientific computing) you can open a terminal
and run</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo port install texlive-latex-extra</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have Latex on your laptop, and it is a UM Mac laptop,
you can install MacTex via the Managed Software Center. Once this is
installed, and your machine is restarted, then you can check that
<code>pdflatex</code> is on the search path by typing in a terminal</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>which pdflatex</code></pre>
<h2 id="if-you-have-problems-running-the-code-in-rstudio">If you have
problems running the code in Rstudio</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Note that the homework does not ask you to use Rstudio. You can
just run R in a terminal window.</p></li>
<li><p>Using Rstudio sometimes introduces problems. This is fairly rare,
but in this particular case it happened to several people that Rstudio
behaved inappropriately with the Rnw file.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, stripping away an unnecessary layer of code (here,
Rstudio) is worth trying when debugging.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation-of-missing-packages">Installation of missing
packages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most people will have to install missing R packages. The code needs
at least the following packages:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>ggplot2, knitr, doParallel, doRNG, fields, pomp, spatPomp</code></pre>
